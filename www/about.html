				<p>
					The purpose of Shining Force Station is to provide an easy
					place to go to for your Shining Force needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many other sites that serve a similar purpose
					though they have all their information spread around,
					each site having a bit of useful content.  Furthermore,
					they have issues with their webhosts, preventing them
					from hosting certain types of content.  This is not a problem
					for me, since I am my own host.

			<!-- About Me -->
			<div class="fancyBorder"><div><div><div>
				<p>
					I'm a high school senior heading off to Arizona State
					University next year.  I'm really interested in computer
					science in general, and more specifically web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been meaning to get myself a server and domain name to
					host and utilize for a while, but have been having an issue
					on deciding what to use it for.  Nonetheless, I bought myself
					a computer to run a server from, and got this domain name.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually I hope to have completed this site, allowing it to
					serve as a guide of Shining Force.  Eventually I intend to
					write a browser based version of Shining Force, but that is 
					much further in the future.
