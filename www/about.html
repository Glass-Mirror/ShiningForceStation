					The purpose of Shining Force Station is to provide an easy
					place to go to for your Shining Force needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many other sites that serve a similar purpose
					though they have all their information spread around,
					each site having a bit of useful content.  Furthermore,
					they have issues with their webhosts, preventing them
					from hosting certain types of content.  This is not a problem
					for me, since I am my own host.

						I'm currently a college student at Arizona State University.  
						specifically, I'm working toward a Computer Science degree, 
						with a concentration in cybersecurity.
					</p>
					<p>
						This site has largely been a passion project.  I loved this game 
						as a kid, we had it on out Sega Genesis that we kept in the 
						basement, and I was constantly playing it.  Since then, I've 
						been able to continue playing using virtual consoles, like on 
						the Nintendo Wii and on Steam.  And, so, I've made this site to 
						help share a game that I love and enjoy, helping people learn 
						about it and giving them resources for their own playthroughs.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I said though, this site is currently under construction, meaning 
						there will be times when it goes down for extended periods of time.  
						Also as I am creating this site based on both my knowledge and that 
						which I can find online, it is likely there will be some errors, 
						in which case, please let me know so I can fix them.
